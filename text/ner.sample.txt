One of the things I've always wanted in Java is a "one liner" trick to read all of the text from a stream. For example, I often want to be able to grab the contents of a URL or file as a simple String, without a lot of typing. The URL class tantalizingly holds out its getContent() method, but sadly, content handlers were never really taken seriously. I don't even particularly care about performance, I'd just like something for the simple case, in standard Java, that's not too hard to remember. Well, the Java 1.5 java.util.Scanner class finally has the answer.
