Breeze is a suite of Scala libraries for numerical processing, machine learning, and natural language processing. Its primary focus is on being generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The library currently consists of several parts:

breeze-math: Linear algebra and numerics routines
breeze-process: Libraries for processing text and managing data pipelines.
breeze-learn: Machine Learning, Statistics, and Optimization.
Possible future releases:

breeze-viz: Vizualization and plotting
breeze-fst: Finite state toolkit
Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because
one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development.
The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.

Epic is a high-performance statistical parser written in Scala. It uses Expectation Propagation to build complex models without suffering the exponential runtimes one would get in a naive model. Epic is nearly state-of-the-art on the standard benchmark dataset in Natural Language Processing. We will be releasing Epic soon.
